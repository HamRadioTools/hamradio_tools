# Grandfathering Security Model

RCLDX uses a social trust model inspired by the idea of 'grandfathering' in tight communities.

## Concept

Every active user with the ability to publish spots must be 'sponsored' by at least two existing and well trusted users (their grandparents).

## Rules

- A user becomes fully active once they have **≥ 2 valid sponsors**.
- Sponsors can withdraw their support at any time.
- If a user falls below 2 sponsors, they are automatically downgraded to **read-only**.

Unlike other ham radio community services, many of which claim to be universally accessible but are effectively restricted for various reasons, RCLDX will always remain accessible to any user in read-only mode, even without grandfather support. This ensures that operators can continue to use and benefit from the cluster during their radio sessions without being impeded.

## Benefits

This design:

- Encourages local social control instead of central authority.
- Makes abuse harder to sustain over time.
- Distributes responsibility across the community.
