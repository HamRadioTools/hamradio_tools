# Grandfathering Security Model

RCLDX uses a social trust model inspired by the idea of 'grandfathering' in tight communities.

## Concept

Every active user with the ability to publish spots must be 'sponsored' by at least two existing, trusted users (their grandparents).

## Rules

- A user becomes fully active once they have **≥ 2 valid sponsors**.
- Sponsors can withdraw their support at any time.
- If a user falls below 2 sponsors, they are downgraded to **read-only**.

## Benefits

This design:

- Encourages local social control instead of central authority.
- Makes abuse harder to sustain over time.
- Distributes responsibility across the community.
