# Authentication

Authentication ensures that we know *who* is behind a connection or a message.

## Broker-level authentication

Core brokers authenticate users through an Identity Provider (IdP) using a basic username and password scheme.

Club brokers authenticate themselves to the core brokers through an IdP using a token-based scheme.

## User authentication details

`TBD`
