# Risk Analysis

This document lists major risks and how we plan to mitigate them.

## Technical risks

- Single core region outage
- Data loss in Redis or storage
- Incorrect ACL or filter configuration

## Social risks

- Abuse of grandfathering (cliques, retaliation)
- Lack of operators to enforce rules
- Conflicts between clubs

## Mitigation strategy

RCLDX combines technical controls (replication, backups, ACLs) with governance processes (clear rules, dispute resolution, transparent decision-making).
