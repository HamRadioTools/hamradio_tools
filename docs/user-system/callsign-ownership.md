# Callsign ownership

Verifying that a user truly owns a callsign is non-trivial.

## Problem statement

Anyone can type any callsign in a client configuration. RCLDX need ways to tie callsigns to actual licensed operators.

## Possible verification methods

- Out-of-band confirmation (i.e., club membership records)
- Publishing verification tokens via DNS or personal websites
- Spot DE/DX
- On-air challenges (experimental)

## Limitations

No method is perfect. RCLDX aims for 'good enough' verification plus ongoing social control via the [grandfathering model](security/grandfathering-model.md).
