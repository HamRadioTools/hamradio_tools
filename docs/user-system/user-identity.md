# User identity

RCLDX is built around ham radio callsigns as the primary identity.

## Core ideas

A user is essentially defined by their callsign plus additional metadata (club membership, roles, sponsorships, votes, etc...).

## Identity storage

Identity data may be stored in a dedicated database or in a lightweight cache structure, depending on the action being performed.

## Privacy considerations

RCLDX minimizes personal data stored and avoid unnecessary PII. The focus is on callsigns and technical behaviour, not real-world identities.
