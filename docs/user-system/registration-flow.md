# Registration Flow

The registration flow defines how a new user onboards into RCLDX.

## Steps

1. User connects to RCLDX Auth service to obtain provisional credentials.
2. User requests sponsorship from existing members.
3. Once ≥ 2 sponsors are granted, user becomes fully active.
4. Optional: user completes a verification challenge for long-term callsign ownership, appearing ad `verified` across all the RCLDX tools and providing extra functionalities.

## Operator tools

Operators use the same RCLDX Auth service web UI / API to review pending sponsorships and manage their data.

## Abuse handling

Users involved in abuse can be demoted or banned, which may cascade through the graph analysis of the recdeived sponsorship within the grandfathering model, as needed.
