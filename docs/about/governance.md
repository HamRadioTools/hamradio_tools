# Governance

RCLDX is proud to self-define as transparent, lightweight and community-oriented.

## Principles

- No single person or entity fully controls the entire system.
- Clear processes are in place for decisions and appeals.
- Roles and responsibilities are documented herein.

## Bodies

Possible bodies include:

- Core Team
- Admins group
- Club operators forum
- The entire community of users, through the power of their vote in the grandfathering system as social control mechanism.

The scalation path should be therefore:

```txt
Community → Club operators → Admins group → Core team
````

## Decision-making

RCLDX uses [open discussion](https://github.com/orgs/HamRadioTools/discussions), rough consensus and documented RFC-style proposals.
