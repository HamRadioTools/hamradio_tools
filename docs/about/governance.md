# Governance

RCLDX is proud to self-define as transparent, lightweight and community-oriented.

## Principles

- No single person or entity fully controls the entire system
- Clear processes are in place for decisions and appeals
- Roles and responsibilities are documented herein

## Bodies

Possible bodies include:

- Core Team
- Admins group
- Club operators forum
- The entire community of users, through the power of their vote in the grandfathering system as social control mechanism.

## Decision-Making

Use open discussion, rough consensus and documented RFC-style proposals.
