# Governance

RCLDX governance should be transparent, lightweight, and community-oriented.

## Principles

- No single person or entity fully controls the system
- Clear processes for decisions and appeals
- Documented roles and responsibilities

## Bodies

Possible bodies include:

- Core Team
- Admins group
- Club operators forum
- The entire community of users, through the power of their vote in the grandfathering system.

## Decision-Making

Use open discussion, rough consensus and documented RFC-style proposals.
