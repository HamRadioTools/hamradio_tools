## RCLDX: a modern DX cluster must be resilient by design

DX clusters should be open.  
They should be fast.  
They should be fair.

They should **not** depend on blind trust and manual firefighting.

----------

### We believe

- Abuse is inevitable in any open system
- Insider threats are the hardest to handle
- Text streams are no longer sufficient
- Federation needs boundaries
- Moderation should be technical, not personal
- Security must be built in, not bolted on

----------

### We reject the idea that

- “it has always worked” means “it will keep working”
- openness and control are opposites
- modernization equals centralization
- adding structure kills ham spirit

----------

### RCLDX exists to prove that

- DX spotting can be global _and_ resilient
- Communities can be autonomous _and_ interconnected
- Trust can be social _and_ technical
- Abuse can be contained without silencing everyone

----------

### This is not about replacing legacy clusters

It is about **ending decades of known limitations**.

----------

### This is not about distrusting radio amateurs

It is about **protecting them from the consequences of unchecked abuse**.

----------

### This is not the end of DX clusters

It is the next iteration.

----------

**RCLDX is not nostalgia.  
RCLDX is infrastructure.**
