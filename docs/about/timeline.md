| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2015      | Idea sparked during a conversation with other hams in Fall after a ham convention in Spain.<br>The discussion started due to attacks to cluster with fake data. |
| 2016      | - Initial conversation with other peers to decide which data the cluster should carry on.<br>- Initial code were started by March 2016. |
| 2017/2019 | - Very low time for radio <br>- Code expanded in modularity.<br>- A technical member of an association in EA asked for a grant(*) to get the code from GitHub and integrate it in their WebCluster initiative.|
| 2020/2021 | Pandemic provided extra time for radio, [un]fortunately.                                                 |
| 2022/2023 | A coffee with other peer hams in Radio Club Lugones sparked again the same cluster improvement idea. |
| 2024      | - Research on needs started; numerous 1-to-1 talks with DX-mans and activators to gather ideas on what a new cluster should provide in terms of functionality. Designing a UI was not in scope.<br>- Initial code from scratch (again). |
| 2025      | - Main code block finished; time to beta test the system.<br>- Begin socializing idea among selected groups of hams, dev teams, and so.<br>- We started the interaction with multiple reference projects for the community looking for opinions and potential collaborations.|
| 2026      | Go live! |
