## Open Source projects

RCLDX builds on the shoulders of giants across the modern distributed-system ecosystem. Its foundation includes:

- Python and Rust for high-performance backend services, async I/O pipelines and protocol handlers.
- PostgreSQL for relational storage, transactional integrity and structured query workloads (SQL).
- Redis for ultra-low-latency caching, ephemeral data structures, pub/sub messaging and rate-limiting primitives.
- NATS/MQTT for lightweight, high-speed message distribution and cluster-to-cluster communication.
- OpenTelemetry (OTLP) for vendor-neutral instrumentation, distributed traces, structured logs and metrics export.
- Prometheus for pull-based metrics collection and time-series storage (PromQL).
- Loki for log aggregation using the Prometheus-style label model (LogQL).
- Grafana for visualization dashboards of metrics, traces and event flows across the cluster.
- Traefik, for edge routing, TLS termination and service discovery.
- NGINX, for web services and API ingress.
- gRPC, ProtoBuf, HTTP/REST and WebSocket interfaces, for internal and external service communication.
- Docker/Nomad, for container scheduling, service orchestration and auto-scaling.
- Consul, for service discovery, distributed key/value coordination and health checks.
- Vault, for secure secret management, dynamic credentials encryption-as-a-service and zero-trust identity workflows.

Together, these components form a resilient, observable and high-performance platform inspired by best practices from modern telemetry systems, distributed brokers and large-scale real-time data networks.
