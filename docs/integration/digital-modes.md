# Integration of digital modes

Digital modes (FT8, FT4, JT65, etc...) plus CW can be tapped as sources for automated spots.

## Source software

Logbooks are encourages to perform the direct integration on behalf of the user. RCLDX provides direct support to logbook developers on this matter.

Popular digital mode software (WSJT-X, JTDX, etc.) can be extended or monitored to extract QSO data for RCLDX.

Integration with Revere Beacon Network is also confirmned simple and easy doable.

## Normalization

Different log formats are normalized into the canonical DX spot schema.

## Ethical considerations

Operators must be transparent when automatically reporting spots to avoid overwhelming the cluster with redundant data.
